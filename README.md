 Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I'm glad you landed on my Github profile.
 I'm Oana and I'm looking for a Junior Manual Tester role as I currently graduated from a Manual Testing course by CodersLab.
 As you can see, my knowledge did not limit to manual testing area and you can find some HTML and CSS little projects in my repositories.
